# Intelligent First-Aid & Medical Assistance System 🏥🤖

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning–based healthcare decision support system that predicts patient condition severity and recommends appropriate medical action.

The system:
- Classifies patient severity as Mild, Moderate, or Severe
- Provides first-aid guidance
- Recommends doctor visits or emergency hospital care
- Identifies nearby hospitals using geolocation (Germany-based routing)

⚠️ This system is a decision-support tool and does not diagnose diseases.

## 🏥 Severity-Based Decision Logic

🟢 Mild  
- First-aid advice  
- Rest and monitoring  

🟡 Moderate  
- Doctor visit recommended  
- Nearby clinic suggestions  

🔴 Severe  
- Emergency case  
- Nearest hospital recommendation  

Hospital routing is performed using OpenStreetMap data and geodesic distance calculations.
